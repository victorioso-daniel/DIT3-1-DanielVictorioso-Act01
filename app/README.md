## Reflection

**1. What challenges did you face installing Android Studio?**  
I had a hard time setting up Android Studio because the SDK and emulator took a long time to download. Some components failed to install at first, and I had to fix them manually. Setting up the emulator to work properly with my computer also took some time.

**2. What did you learn about Android app structure?**  
I learned that an Android project has folders like `manifests`, `java` or `kotlin`, and `res`.  
Each folder has its purpose — the `manifest` is for app settings, the `java/kotlin` folder has the code, and `res` has the resources like layouts and images.  
I also learned how Gradle is used to manage the project and build the app.
