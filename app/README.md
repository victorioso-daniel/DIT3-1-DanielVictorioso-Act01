## 🧠 Reflection

**1. What challenges did you face installing Android Studio?**  
Setting up Android Studio took time — the SDK and emulator downloads were quite slow, and a few components failed to install at first. I had to manually fix some missing parts and configure the emulator properly before everything worked smoothly.

**2. What did you learn about Android app structure?**  
I learned that an Android project is organized into different folders with specific purposes:  
- `manifests/` → defines app settings and permissions  
- `java/` or `kotlin/` → contains the source code  
- `res/` → stores layouts, images, and UI resources  

I also understood how **Gradle** manages dependencies and builds the app efficiently.
